# 📖 Developer documentation

## ⁉️ Purpose of this documentation

This documentation is intended to the **future developers** re-using your work, e.g. students from next year.
They have the same proficiencies that you have and are interested in understanding how your code is structured and how they can extend it with new features.

## ⁉️ Do we really need to feed this section? 

Maybe not, if your project does not include code or if it is trivial. If so, drop the section and the links.


## ⁉️ What is expected here
Your user documentation must give and overview of the structure of your code. 
Include any information that is needed e.g. ROS topics and services, tweakable parameters, how to update firmwares...
It may include images, usually technical diagrams e.g. UML diagrams (class diagram or activity diagram).
