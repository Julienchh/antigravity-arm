## Specifications

Describe the **context** and the **need** that forced your client to submit this project to you.

Describe what is the **expected output** of your project. Make sure that your contribution to this project is explicit.

## Implemented approch

Describe your **approach** and how you proceeded to solve the problems reported by the client
 the work to solve this problem.

Add links to relevant sections to your user documentation and developer documentation but do not duplicate information.

## Analysis of results

**Qualify** and **quantify** your achievements. Make measurements from your work, e.g.:

* **User tests**: Setup a methodology to test the efficiency of your project against users. It may use pre-experiment and post-experiment questionnaires. The most users the better to draw meaningful conclusions from your experiments. Radar diagrams are good to summarize such results.
* **Table of data**: Provide (short) extracts of data and relevant statistics (distribution, mean, standard deviation, p-values...)
* **Plots**: Most data are more demonstrative when represented as plots. 

Draw conclusions, **interpret** the results and make recommandations to your client for your future of the work.
It is totally fine to have results that are not as good as initially expected. Be honest and analyse why you did not manage to reach the objectives.
